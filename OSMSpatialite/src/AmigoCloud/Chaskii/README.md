This is a subset of the Chaskii library found in amigoclient.

We only need the Math portion of the library, so we are only including
those files. If you would like to use the full Chaskii library, you can
[find it in amigoclient](https://github.com/amigocloud/amigoclient/tree/e29169fe6ee85c986832989a7af043f6a4aece95/core/include/Chaskii).

Chaskii is an open source library used in Google Earth (proprietary). I haven't found a good repo for this library other than AmigoCloud's AmigoClient.
